    <h3>Description </h3>

    <div>    
        <p>
            Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically 
            consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough 
            topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, 
            baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[2]

        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Starter</h4>
            <li>1 cup (120g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (113g) water</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <h4>Dough</h4>
            <li>3/4 cup (170g) water</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups (270g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (8g) King Arthur Pizza Dough Flavor, optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) table salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil</li>
            <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <li>tomato sauce, meats and/or vegetables, and cheeses of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>To make the starter: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a mixing bowl or the pan of your bread machine, stir together the flour, water and yeast. Set aside, covered, to rest overnight or all day.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>To make the dough</strong>: Add the flour and water to the starter, mix well, and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Add the remaining dough ingredients, mixing and kneading to form a smooth dough.</p></li>
            <li><p>Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes; gently fold the edges to the middle, turn it over, and let it rise an additional 45 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a 9" round, place on a piece of parchment cut to fit, cover, and let rest while you heat your oven to 500°F.</p></li>
            <li><p>After about 30 minutes, use a giant spatula or pizza peel to transfer the pizza to your hot oven stone; or place it on a pan on the lowest rack of your oven.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake for 4 minutes, then remove from the oven, and top with your favorite toppings. Return the pizzas to the lowest rack of the oven (not to the stone), and bake for an additional 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling bubbly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Store any leftover pizza, well wrapped, in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tips from our bakers</h3>
        <p>The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500°F, and at temperatures between 450°F and 500°F parchment’s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450°F (especially anything on an upper rack). Burned edges can also be minimized by trimming away excess parchment before baking.</p>
